Step-1:
1. Create a new virtual environment "conda create -p venv python=3.11.5" to give your python version
2. Activate the virtual environment - "conda activate venv/"
----------------------------------------------------------------
Step-2
1. Initialized the git
2. Added gitignore file in both github and vs   
----------------------------------------------------------------
Step-3
1. Write code for setup.py
  - The setup.py file is a standard Python file used to package and distribute Python projects. 
  - It’s a crucial part of the Python packaging ecosystem, allowing developers to define the project’s metadata, dependencies, and installation requirements.
  - When a Python project includes a setup.py file, it becomes easier for others to install and use the project via tools like pip or for uploading to repositories like PyPI (Python Package Index).
2. Write the requirements.txt file
  - The requirements.txt file is a simple text file used in Python projects to list the external libraries or dependencies that the project needs to run. 
  - It is commonly used to document the exact packages and their versions that your project relies on, making it easy for others to install the same dependencies.
  - When ever you use new library dependencies you mention them in this document
  - Instead of manually installing each package one by one, users can install all the required packages listed in requirements.txt with a single command:
    --> pip install -r requirements.txt
----------------------------------------------------------------
Step-4:
1. Write the logger.py
  - It is a common utility file used to handle logging in a Python project, 
  making it easier to trace the program's execution, track errors, and debug the application effectively.
2. Write the exception.py
  - It is a common utility file used to raise exceptions
----------------------------------------------------------------
Step-5:
1. Created notebook folder and to perform EDA analysis
2. Write data_wrangling.py
3. model_trainings.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Step-6
1. Writing the code in the components folder
2. data_ingestion.py, data_transformaiton.py, model_training.py
